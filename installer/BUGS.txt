Current bugs in the installer

* Choosing SVN versions and alias files needs to be interactive or have an easier way to edit which one you want (maybe command line switches or a conf file)

* installer does not stop/restart wampserver services. services will not get an updated PATH until reboot.
C:\wamp\wampmanager.exe -restart

* uninstaller has not been tested in a long while

* svn anonymous read/write hasn't been tested in a while

* possibly have a way to install multiple svn.conf files and swap between them from the wampserver
menu similar to the "put online" option.

* getting an occassional access denied error when moving files around. Dropbox may be the problem. addon folder was first
copied from dropbox folder to desktop and then the install script was run from the desktop copy.
