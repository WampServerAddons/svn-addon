Current bugs in the installer

* it can not download the SVN binaries from the internet because the files seem to redirect in an infinite loop
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/win32svn/1.6.17/Setup-Subversion-1.6.17.msi?r=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fwin32svn%2F&ts=1318522620&use_mirror=cdnetworks-us-2

* Choosing SVN versions and alias files needs to be interactive or have an easier way to edit which one you want (maybe command line switches or a conf file)

* installer does not stop/restart wampserver services
C:\wamp\wampmanager.exe -restart

* no error handling in case files/directories exist

* windows requires reboot to get server to detect modules see if this can be avoided.

* uninstaller has not been tested in a long while
