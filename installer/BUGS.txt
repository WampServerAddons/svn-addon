Current bugs in the installer

* Choosing SVN versions and alias files needs to be interactive or have an easier way to edit which one you want (maybe command line switches or a conf file)

* installer does not stop/restart wampserver services
C:\wamp\wampmanager.exe -restart

* no error handling in case files/directories exist

* windows requires reboot to get server to detect modules see if this can be avoided.

* uninstaller has not been tested in a long while

* svn anonymous read/write hasn't been tested in a while

* possibly have a way to install multiple svn.conf files and swap between them from the wampserver
menu similar to the "put online" option.
